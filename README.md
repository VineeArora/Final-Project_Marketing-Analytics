# Final Project - Marketing Analytics 

This project is developed as part of Bootcamp's Final Submission. The project consists of a Website, Online presence strategy, Customer persona and journey, MarTech stack, Tracking plan along with Data visualisations & findings.

Here's the scenario for the project -

<b>Setup:</b>
Our client Think Tank is an education provider in Berlin. Since many students have transfered their studies online and now join remotely, they donâ€™t have anyone to study in the classrooms and infrastucture is unused. As a result we have classrooms which are empty across 3 locations within Germany. Our idea is to build a booking platform webpage that offers those workspaces to digital workers in need of modern offices and help our client build revenue on the same. Interested parties can book offices on a daily basis + as an individual or company. The main interest is growing the revenue solely online from this renting-out-model by XYZ% by the end of 6 / 12 months.
